INSTALLATION

A. Prerequisites.

1. Standard POSIX 2008.1 compliant shell.
2. Java 7 or 8. Symlink into /usr/bin/java is recommended.
3. GNU tar (preferred) or other tar flavor.
4. Some kind of compression filter. GZip is sufficient, xz is recommended.
    Keep in mind that the better the compression ratio, the more time and
    resources it will take.
5. GNU screen (strongly recommended).

B. Fast portable install.

1. Unpack archive.
2. Move all files from `archive/bin' directory to the root directory of your
    server. Preserve executable bits!
3. Copy `config/launcher.properties.sample' to `server/launcher.properties'
    and adjust its values.
4. Copy `config/jvm.properties.sample' to `server/jvm.properties' and adjust
    its values.
5. Start server: "server/mcsc.sh start".

C. Separate install.

1. Place the scripts wherever you can reach them.
2. Set `$MCSC_DIR' environment variable to specify server root directory.
3. Copy `*.sample' files to the server root directory, remove the `.sample'
    suffix and adjust them as you see fit.
4. Start server: "mcsc.sh start".

D. Multiserver install.

Goes much like Separate install in the previous example, except you create a
separate user+profile for each server, and script will look in the user's
`$HOME' directory for launcher and daemon configuration.

1. Place the scripts wherever you can reach them.
2. Create a system user+profile for each server instance.
3. Copy .sample files to the server root (user home) directory, remove the
    ".sample" suffix and adjust them as you see fit.
4. Start server: "mcsc.sh start" from the user account.

Make sure the `$HOME' variable is set before you launch the instance (this is
for system init scripts).
